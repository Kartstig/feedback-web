Feedback is a cause based organization with the mission to divert food waste and surplus to fight food insecurity and end hunger in Franklin County! 
      In central Ohio, there are more than 200,000 people and more than 60,000 children who are food-insecure. That's twice the size of the OSU Football Stadium! 
      Food insecurity is lacking reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has created a Food Scraps Recovery Initiative and it includes some sobering facts...
      Nearly 500lbs of food waste are generated in the typical Ohio household. Approximately 90% of waste generated by resturaunts and grocery stores is food scraps. 
      The Ohio EPA encourages communities and businesses to divert food scraps; not only does the environment benefit from keeping food scraps out of landfills, but communities and businesses can save money by reducing their disposal costs.
      
      Feedback is an innovative solution to linking together food producers with the needs of recipients. By developing a platform for meaningful exchange, Feedback supports and enables the ability of donors to contribute their waste resources.
      Navigating food safety and inspection obstacles can impede the well intentioned efforts of a donating business, but our technology makes the process seemless and secure. 
      We believe aligning our goals with the needs of food insecure communities is the best approach to creating a coalition capable of fighting hunger. We invite you to join us in our battle against empty bellies in whichever way is right for you.
